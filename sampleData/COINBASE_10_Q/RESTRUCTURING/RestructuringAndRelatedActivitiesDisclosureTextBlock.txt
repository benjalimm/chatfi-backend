"RESTRUCTURING
In June 2022, the Company announced and completed a restructuring impacting approximately 18% of the Company’s headcount. This
strategic reduction of the existing global workforce was intended to manage the Company’s operating expenses in response to market
conditions and ongoing business prioritization efforts. As a result, approximately 1,100 employees in various departments and
locations were terminated. As part of their termination, they were given separation pay and other personnel benefits.
The following expenses were recognized within restructuring expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 (in thousands). The Company does not expect to incur any additional charges in
connection with this restructuring.
