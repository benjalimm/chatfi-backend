Customer custodial cash and customer custodial cash liabilities
Customer custodial cash represents restricted cash and cash equivalents maintained in segregated Company bank accounts that are
held for the exclusive benefit of customers. Customer custodial cash liabilities represent cash deposits held by customers in
their fiat wallets and unsettled deposits and withdrawals. The Company restricts the use of the assets underlying the customer
custodial cash to meet regulatory requirements and classifies the assets as current based on their purpose and availability to
fulfill the Company’s direct obligation under customer custodial cash liabilities.
Certain jurisdictions where the Company operates require the Company to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable
regulatory requirements and commercial law in these jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer
custodial cash liabilities. Depending on the jurisdiction, eligible liquid assets can include cash and cash equivalents, customer
custodial cash, and in-transit customer receivables. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company’s eligible liquid
assets were greater than the aggregate amount of customer custodial cash liabilities.
