"REVENUE
Revenue recognition
The Company determines revenue recognition from contracts with customers through the following steps:
•identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer;
•identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•determination of the transaction price;
•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•recognition of the revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects
the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company primarily generates
revenue through transaction fees charged on the platform.

(1)During the third quarter of 2022, the Company rebranded the “Earn” campaign to the “Learning Rewards” campaign. $7.4 million
and $15.8 million of Learning Rewards revenue is included within other subscription and services revenue for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. $15.2 million and $43.2 million of Learning Rewards revenue has been reclassified
from its own line item into other subscription and services revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021,
respectively, to conform to the current period presentation.
Transaction revenue
Retail transaction revenue represents transaction fees earned from customers that are primarily individuals, while institutional
transaction revenue represents transaction fees earned from institutional customers, such as hedge funds, family offices,
principal trading firms, and financial institutions on the institutional platform. Institutional clients can trade via the
Company’s trading platform or utilize Coinbase Prime services depending on their needs. High-frequency trading firms, such as
market makers and principal traders, benefit from lower latency by connecting through the trading platform, while corporations and
family offices can access an integrated suite of investment services through Coinbase Prime.
The Company’s service is comprised of a single performance obligation to provide a crypto asset matching service when customers
buy, sell, or convert crypto assets on the platform. That is, the Company is an agent in transactions between customers and
presents revenue for the fees earned on a net basis.
Judgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions between customers. The
Company evaluates the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether it controls the crypto asset provided
before it is transferred to the customer (gross) or whether it acts as an agent by arranging for other customers on the platform
to provide the crypto asset to the customer (net). The Company does not control the crypto asset being provided before it is
transferred to the buyer, does not have inventory risk related to the crypto asset, and is not responsible for the fulfillment of
the crypto asset. The Company also does not set the price for the crypto asset as the price is a market rate established by users
of the platform. As a result, the Company acts as an agent in facilitating the ability for a customer to purchase crypto assets
from another customer.
The Company considers its performance obligation satisfied, and recognizes revenue, at the point in time the transaction is
processed. Contracts with customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty.
Therefore, contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already provided.
The Company charges a fee at the transaction level. The transaction price, represented by the trading fee, is calculated based on
volume and varies depending on payment type and the value of the transaction. Crypto asset purchase or sale transactions executed
by a customer on the Company’s platform is based on tiered pricing that is driven primarily by transaction volume processed for a
specific historical period. The Company has concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future
material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. The transaction
fee is collected from the customer at the time the transaction is executed. In certain instances, the transaction fee can be
collected in crypto assets, with revenue measured based on the amount of crypto assets received and the fair value of the crypto
assets at the time of the transaction.
The transaction price includes estimates for reductions in revenue from transaction fee reversals that may not be recovered from
customers. Such reversals occur when the customer disputes a transaction processed on their credit card or their bank account for
a variety of reasons and seeks to have the charge reversed after the Company has processed the transaction. These amounts are
estimated based upon the most likely amount of consideration to which the Company will be entitled. All estimates are based on
historical experience and the Company’s best judgment at the time to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of
revenue recognized will not occur. All estimates of variable consideration are reassessed periodically. The total transaction
price is allocated to the single performance obligation. While the Company recognizes transaction fee reversals as a reduction of
net revenue, crypto asset losses related to those same transaction reversals are included in transaction expense.
Blockchain rewards
The Company generates revenues in crypto assets through various blockchain protocols. These blockchain protocols, or the
participants that form the protocol networks, reward users for performing various activities on the blockchain, such as
participating in proof-of-stake networks and other consensus algorithms. The Company considers itself the principal in
transactions with the blockchain networks, and therefore presents such blockchain rewards earned on a gross basis. Blockchain
rewards are primarily comprised of staking revenue in which the Company participates in networks with proof-of-stake consensus
algorithms, through creating or validating blocks on the network using the staking validators that it controls. In exchange for
participating in the consensus mechanism of these networks, the Company earns rewards in the form of the native token of the
network. Each block creation or validation is a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the point when the block creation
or validation is complete and the rewards are transferred into a digital wallet that the Company controls. Revenue is measured
based on the number of tokens received and the fair value of the token at contract inception. Blockchain services offered as part
of Coinbase Cloud’s blockchain infrastructure solutions are included in other subscription and services revenue.
Custodial fee revenue
The Company provides a dedicated secure cold storage solution to customers and earns a fee, which is based on a contractual
percentage of the daily value of assets under custody. The fee is collected on a monthly basis. These contracts typically have one
performance obligation which is provided and satisfied over the term of the contracts as customers simultaneously receive and
consume the benefits of the services. The contract may be terminated by a customer at any time, without incurring a penalty.
Customers are billed on the last day of the month during which services were provided, with the amounts being due within thirty
days of receipt of the invoice. Accounts receivable from customers for custodial fee revenue, net of allowance, were $9.0 million
and $22.4 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The allowance recognized against these fees was
not material for any of the periods presented.
Interest income and corporate interest and other income
The Company holds customer custodial cash and cash and cash equivalents at certain third-party banks which earn interest. The
Company also earns interest income under a revenue sharing arrangement with the issuer of USDC and on loans issued to retail and
institutional users. Interest income is calculated using the interest method and is not within the scope of Topic 606 – Revenue
from Contracts with Customers. Interest earned on customer custodial cash, revenue sharing, and loans is included in interest
income within subscription and services revenue. Interest earned on cash and cash equivalents is included in corporate interest
and other income, within other revenue.
Other subscription and services revenue
Other subscription and services revenue primarily includes revenue from Coinbase Cloud, which includes staking application,
delegation, and infrastructure services, Coinbase One, Learning Rewards, and other subscription licenses. Generally, revenue from
other subscription and services contains one performance obligation, may have variable and non-cash consideration, and is
recognized at a point in time or over the period that services are provided.
Other revenue
Other revenue includes the sale of crypto assets and corporate interest and other income. Periodically, as an accommodation to
customers, the Company may fulfill customer transactions using the Company’s own crypto assets held for operating purposes. The
Company has custody and control of the crypto assets prior to the sale to the customer and records revenue at the point in time
when the sale to the customer is processed. Accordingly, the Company records the total value of the sale in other revenue and the
cost of the crypto assets in other operating expense, net within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The cost of
crypto assets used in fulfilling customer transactions was $0.2 million and $68.6 million for the three months ended September 30,
2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, and $0.5 million and $433.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and
September 30, 2021, respectively.
Related party transactions
Certain of the Company’s directors, executive officers, and principal owners, including immediate family members, are users of the
Company’s platform. The Company recognized revenue from related party customers of $1.9 million and $7.7 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, and $9.5 million and $21.0 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, amounts receivable from
related party customers were $3.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, customer custodial cash
liabilities due to related party customers were $34.6 million. As of December 31, 2021, customer custodial cash liabilities due to
related party customers were immaterial.
