The Company safeguards crypto assets for customers in digital wallets and portions of cryptographic keys necessary to access
crypto assets on the Company’s platform. The Company safeguards these assets and/or keys and is obligated to safeguard them from
loss, theft, or other misuse. The Company records customer crypto assets as well as corresponding customer crypto liabilities, in
accordance with recently adopted guidance, SAB 121. The Company maintains a record of all assets in digital wallets held on the
Company’s platform as well as the full or a portion of private keys including backup keys, which are maintained on behalf of
customers. For crypto assets that are not maintained on the Company’s platform and for which the Company does not maintain a
private key or the ability to recover a customer’s private key, these balances are not recorded, as there is no related
safeguarding obligation in accordance with SAB 121. The Company records the assets and liabilities, on the initial recognition and
at each reporting date, at the fair value of the crypto assets which it safeguards for its customers.


The Company has committed to securely store all crypto assets and cryptographic keys (or portions thereof) it holds on behalf of
customers, and the value of these assets have been recorded as customer crypto liabilities and corresponding customer crypto
assets. As such, the Company may be liable to its customers for losses arising from theft or loss of private keys. The Company has
no reason to believe it will incur any expense associated with such potential liability because (i) it has no known or historical
experience of claims to use as a basis of measurement, (ii) it accounts for and continually verifies the amount of crypto assets
on its platform, and (iii) it has established security around private key management to minimize the risk of theft or loss. The
Company has adopted a number of measures to safeguard crypto assets it secures including, but not limited to, holding customer
crypto assets on a 1:1 basis at all times and strategically storing custodied assets offline using Coinbase’s cold storage
process. The Company also does not reuse or rehypothecate customer crypto assets nor grant security interests in customer crypto
assets, in each case unless required by law or expressly agreed to by the customer. Any loss or theft would impact the measurement
of the customer crypto assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, no losses have been incurred in connection with
customer crypto assets.
