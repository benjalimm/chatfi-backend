Loans receivable
The Company issues fiat loans to consumers and institutions. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had issued loans with
an outstanding balance of $98.2 million and $218.5 million, respectively. The related interest receivable on the loans as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $0.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
The amounts loaned are collateralized with crypto assets held by the borrower in their crypto asset wallet on the Company’s
platform. The Company does not have the right to use such collateral unless the borrower defaults on the loans. Due to the
collateral requirements, the Company's process for collateral maintenance, and collateral held on platform, the Company’s credit
exposure is significantly limited and no allowance was recorded against these loans receivable. The loans are measured at
amortized cost. The carrying value of the loans approximates their fair value due to their short-term duration of less than 12
months. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no loans receivable past due. See Note 12. Accrued Expenses and Other Current
Liabilities, for additional details regarding the Company’s obligation to return collateral.

maintenance, and collateral held on platform, the Company’s credit exposure is significantly limited and no allowance, write-offs
or recoveries were recorded against these crypto asset loan receivables as of and during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021
and 2020. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no crypto asset loan receivables past due.
