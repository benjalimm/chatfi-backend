"STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Stock plans
The Company maintains four equity incentive plans: the 2013 Plan, the 2019 Plan, and the 2021 Plan (together, the “Plans”), and
the ESPP. Following the Direct Listing, the Company has only issued awards under the 2021 Plan and the ESPP, and no additional
awards will be granted under the 2013 Plan and 2019 Plan. In addition, certain of the Company’s existing options assumed in
connection with acquisitions are governed by the terms of the acquired company’s equity awards plan.
In February 2021, the Board approved and adopted the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan became effective on March 31, 2021, the date
immediately prior to the effective date of the Company’s registration statement for the Direct Listing. The 2021 Plan serves as
the successor to the 2019 Plan. Outstanding awards under the 2013 Plan and 2019 Plan continue to be subject to their original
terms and conditions. The 2021 Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options, RSUs, restricted stock, stock
appreciation rights and performance and stock bonus awards to assist in attracting, retaining and motivating employees. The number
of shares available for grant and issuance under the 2021 Plan will be automatically increased on January 1st of each of the first
ten fiscal years during the term of the 2021 Plan by the lesser of (a) five percent of the total number of shares of all classes
of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding on an as converted to common stock basis on each December 31st immediately
prior to the date of increase or (b) such number of shares determined by the Board.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, only stock options and RSUs were issued and outstanding under the Plans.
Stock options
Options granted under the Plans may be either incentive stock options (“ISOs”) or nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”). ISOs may be
granted only to Company employees (including officers and directors who are also employees). NSOs may be granted to Company
employees and non-employees.
Options under the Plans may be granted for contractual periods of up to ten years and at prices determined by the Board, provided,
however, that the exercise price of an ISO and NSO shall not be less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the underlying
shares on the date of the grant (110% if granted to a stockholder who owns more than ten percent of the total combined voting
power of all classes of stock of the Company or any parent or subsidiary).
Under the 2013 Plan and 2019 Plan, options granted to new employees of the Company generally vest over four years and vest at a
rate of 25% upon the first anniversary of the issuance date and 1/48 per month thereafter. Refresher options granted to existing
employees of the Company generally vest in equal monthly installments over four years. No additional awards have been or will be
granted under the 2013 Plan and 2019 Plan following the Company’s Direct Listing.
Under the 2021 Plan, options are granted to executives and eligible non-executive employees which vest in equal quarterly
installments over a period of three years.
The 2013 Plan and 2019 Plan allow for a seven-year exercise window post-termination for employees of the Company who have provided
at least two years of continuous service to the Company as of their termination date.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted stock options for the purchase of 937,247 shares of the Company’s
Class A common stock with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $82.30 per share to certain employees of the Company. The
stock options vest over three years at a rate of 1/12 per quarter.
As of December 31, 2022, there was total unrecognized compensation cost of $130.2 million related to unvested stock options. These
costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.3 years.
The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying stock option award and the
estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $336.3 million and $5.9 billion, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, 7,592,673 stock options vested with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $12.46
per share. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 14,966,504 stock options vested with a weighted-average grant date fair value
of $8.74 per share.
The assumptions used under the Black-Scholes-Merton Option-Pricing Model and the weighted average calculated value of the options
granted to employees were as follows:

Early exercise of stock options
Stock options granted under the Plans provide employee option holders the right to exercise unvested options for restricted common
stock, which is subject to a repurchase right held by the Company at the original purchase price in the event the optionee’s
employment is terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily prior to vesting of the exercised stock. Early exercises of options
are not deemed to be substantive exercises for accounting purposes and accordingly, amounts received for early exercises are
recorded as a liability. These repurchase terms are considered to be a forfeiture provision and do not result in variable
accounting. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 166,481 and 478,271 shares, respectively, subject to repurchase related
to stock options early exercised and not yet vested, but that are expected to vest. These amounts are reclassified to common stock
and additional paid in capital as the underlying shares vest. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a liability
related to these shares subject to repurchase in the amount of $3.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively, which is included
within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Chief Executive Officer performance award
On August 11, 2020, the Company granted its Chief Executive Officer an option award to purchase up to 9,293,911 shares of the
Company’s Class A common stock, at an exercise price of $23.46 per share. Vesting of the award is dependent on both
performance-based and market-based conditions being met.
The performance condition was contingent on the Company’s registration statement being declared effective by the SEC under the
Securities Act. The occurrence of this event was considered to not be probable until such time that it occurred. The market
condition is contingent on the Company’s Class A common stock price achieving stock price target milestones.
The total grant date fair value of this award was $56.7 million. The Company determined the fair value of the option using a Monte
Carlo Simulation Model (a binomial lattice-based valuation model). The Monte Carlo Simulation Model uses multiple input variables
to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements. The fair value of the option is not subject to
change based on future market conditions. Once the performance condition becomes probable of being achieved, the fair value of the
option is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period, using the accelerated attribution method
regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied.
During April 2021, as a result of the Company’s registration statement being declared effective by the SEC, the performance
condition of the option award granted to the Chief Executive Officer was met. On July 8, 2021, the first price target of the award
was met, resulting in the vesting of 3,159,930 shares subject to the option award. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021
and 2020, compensation expense of $3.9 million, $29.5 million and $0 was recognized related to this award, respectively.
Restricted stock units
The Company’s RSUs vest upon the satisfaction of a service-based condition. In general, the RSUs vest over a service period
ranging from one to four years. Once vested, the RSUs are settled by delivery of the Company’s Class A common stock.
Activity of RSUs outstanding are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

For RSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2022, the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock as reported on
The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the grant date was used as the fair value.
In December 2022, the Company modified certain RSU awards held by 1,198 employees to accelerate vesting of the remaining unvested
awards on December 21, 2022 instead of the original vest date of February 20, 2023. The modification of awards did not result in
any incremental compensation cost, however $36.1 million of stock-based compensation expense was accelerated and recognized upon
modification.
As of December 31, 2022, there was total unrecognized compensation cost of $605.7 million related to unvested RSUs. These costs
are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years.
Restricted common stock
As part of the Company’s acquisitions, the Company has issued shares of restricted Class A common stock. Vesting of this
restricted Class A common stock is dependent on a service-based vesting condition that is generally satisfied over three years.
The Company has the right to repurchase shares at par value for which the vesting condition is not satisfied. Activity of shares
of restricted Class A common stock is as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

As of December 31, 2022, there was total unrecognized compensation cost of $135.1 million related to unvested restricted Class A
common stock. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In February 2021, the Board approved and adopted the ESPP. The ESPP became effective on April 1, 2021, the effective date of the
Company’s registration statement for the Direct Listing. The ESPP allows eligible employees the option to purchase shares of the
Company's Class A common stock at a 15% discount, over a series of offering periods through accumulated payroll deductions over
the period. The ESPP also includes a look-back provision for the purchase price if the stock price on the purchase date is lower
than the stock price on the offering date. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expenses related to purchase rights
issued pursuant to its ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 24 months. The fair value of purchase
rights under the ESPP is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option-Pricing Model.
The number of shares available for grant and issuance under the ESPP will be automatically increased on January 1st of each of the
first ten fiscal years during the term of the ESPP by the lesser of (a) one percent of the total number of shares of all classes
of the Company’s common stock outstanding on an as converted to common stock basis on each December 31st immediately prior to the
date of increase or (b) such number of shares determined by the Board or the compensation committee of the Board.
The grant date of the initial offering period was May 3, 2021, and that offering period will end on April 30, 2023. Subsequent
offering periods will commence in each May and November after the start of the initial offering period. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, total compensation expense of $28.4 million was recognized related to the ESPP. As of December 31, 2022, the
Company recorded a liability of $6.7 million related to the accumulated payroll deductions, which are refundable to employees who
withdraw from the ESPP. This amount is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.
Stock-based compensation expense
Stock-based compensation is included in the following components of expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of
