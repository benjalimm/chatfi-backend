The Company’s effective tax rate of 14.35% for 2022 reflects a tax benefit on pretax loss reduced by certain nondeductible
compensation and a valuation allowance recorded on impairment charges. The Company’s effective tax rate of (19.73)% for 2021
reflects a tax benefit on pretax income due primarily to deductible stock option exercises as a result of the Company’s Direct
Listing, and research and development credits.
The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was significantly lower compared to 2020 due primarily to an increase in 2021 tax
benefits from deductible stock options as a result of the Company’s Direct Listing, and an increase in 2021 research and
development credits.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.0 billion in net deferred tax assets. At each reporting date, management considers new
evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. On the basis of
this evaluation, only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized was recognized. However,
if the Company is not able to generate sufficient taxable income from its operations in the future, then a valuation allowance to
reduce the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets may be required, which would increase the Company’s expenses in the period the
allowance is recognized.
A valuation allowance of $252.3 million and $54.4 million was recorded against the Company’s net deferred tax asset balance as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022 includes allowances primarily related to
realized and unrealized capital losses on digital assets and Coinbase Ventures investments, and California research and
development credits.
In accordance with the Company’s adoption of SAB 121, a deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability are being disclosed relating
to safeguarded customer crypto assets and liabilities. A deferred tax asset is reported on the safeguarded liability, and an
offsetting deferred tax liability, measured at the same amount, is reported on the safeguarded assets.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $1.3 billion, and as of December 31,
2021 the Company estimated a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $873.6 million. On the Company’s 2021 tax return,
the Company elected to capitalize expenses which replaced the estimated 2021 net operating loss carryforward into 2022. The U.S.
federal net operating losses carry forward indefinitely. Additionally, the Company had U.S. state net operating losses of $1.4
billion as of December 31, 2022. Generally, California and other significant U.S. states have a twenty-year carryforward for net
operating losses.
Activity related to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits consisted of the following (in thousands):

Year Ended December 31,202220212020Balance, beginning of year$111,019 $12,807 $10,344 Settlements(6,128)— — Increase related to

year$124,106 $111,019 $12,807 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $124.1 million and $111.0 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits,
of which $114.4 million and $84.9 million, respectively, would reduce income tax expense and affect the effective tax rate, if
recognized. It is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next twelve months
as a result of audit closures. The potential reduction in unrecognized tax benefits is $2.2 million, of which $1.8 million would
favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to exposures as a
component of income tax expense. The Company recorded $0.5 million and $0.3 million of accrued interest and penalties,
respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $0.6 million and $0.4 million of accrued interest and penalties, respectively, as of
December 31, 2021.
The Company files U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations.
Currently these statutes of limitations are open from 2020 forward for the U.S., 2018 forward for California, 2021 forward for the
United Kingdom, and 2018 forward for Ireland. During 2022, the IRS completed the audit of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax
returns for years 2017 to 2019, and the state of California completed the audit of the Company’s income tax returns for 2016 to
2017.
