(1)    Derivative transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount; however, this amount is not recorded on the
consolidated balance sheets and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the derivative
instruments. The notional amount is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the underlying basis on which the value of
exchange payments or settlement under these contracts are determined.
The following tables summarize information on derivative assets and liabilities that are reflected on the Company’s consolidated
balance sheets, by accounting designation (in thousands):
