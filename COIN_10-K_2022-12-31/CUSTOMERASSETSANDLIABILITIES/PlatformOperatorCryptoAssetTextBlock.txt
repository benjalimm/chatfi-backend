(1)The Company adopted SAB 121 as of January 1, 2022. Prior to 2022, the Company did not record customer crypto assets and
liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets.


The Company safeguards crypto assets for customers in digital wallets and portions of cryptographic keys necessary to access
crypto assets on the Company’s platform. The Company safeguards these assets and/or keys and is obligated to safeguard them from
loss, theft, or other misuse. The Company records customer crypto assets as well as corresponding customer crypto liabilities, in
accordance with recently adopted guidance, SAB 121. The Company maintains a record of all assets in digital wallets held on the
Company’s platform as well as the full or a portion of private keys including backup keys, which are maintained on behalf of
customers. For crypto assets where the Company does not maintain a private key or the ability to recover a customer’s private key,
these balances are not recorded, as there is no related safeguarding obligation in accordance with SAB 121. The Company records
the assets and liabilities, on the initial recognition and at each reporting date, at the fair value of the crypto assets which it
safeguards for its customers.


The Company has committed to securely store all crypto assets and cryptographic keys (or portions thereof) it holds on behalf of
customers, and the value of these assets have been recorded as customer crypto liabilities and corresponding customer crypto
assets. As such, the Company may be liable to its customers for losses arising from theft or loss of private keys. The Company has
no reason to believe it will incur any expense associated with such potential liability because (i) it has no known or historical
experience of claims to use as a basis of measurement, (ii) it accounts for and continually verifies the amount of crypto assets
on its platform, and (iii) it has established security around private key management to minimize the risk of theft or loss. The
Company has adopted a number of measures to safeguard crypto assets it secures including, but not limited to, holding customer
crypto assets on a 1:1 basis and strategically storing custodied assets offline using Coinbase’s cold storage process. The Company
also does not reuse or rehypothecate customer crypto assets nor grant security interests in customer crypto assets, in each case
unless required by law or expressly agreed to by the customer. Any loss or theft would impact the measurement of the customer
crypto assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, no losses have been incurred in connection with customer crypto assets.
As of December 31, 2022, customer crypto assets and customer crypto liabilities safeguarded for related parties were $3.5 billion.
As of December 31, 2022, customer custodial cash liabilities due to related party customers were $14.2 million. As of December 31,
2021, customer custodial cash liabilities due to related party customers were immaterial.
The following table sets forth the fair value of customer crypto assets, as shown on the consolidated balance sheets, as customer
