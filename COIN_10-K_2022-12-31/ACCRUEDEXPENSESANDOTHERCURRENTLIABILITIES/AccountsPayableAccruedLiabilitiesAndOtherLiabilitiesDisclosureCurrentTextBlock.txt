Short-term borrowings
Short-term borrowings include borrowings with open terms or amounts payable within the next 12 months or sooner at the option of
the Company or the lender. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings were 4.49% and 5.00% per annum as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repaid an aggregate of $191.1 million of
short-term borrowings.
Obligation to return collateral
For loans receivable and crypto asset loans receivables, the Company requires borrowers to post collateral. The collateral
requirements range from 30% to 175% of the fair value of the loan, and the borrower is required to pledge additional assets to
maintain their required collateral percentage. The collateral pledged by borrowers is held on the Company’s platform and the
Company may have the right to use the collateral. If the Company has the right to use the collateral, or if the collateral is
fiat, the Company records the collateral as an asset with a corresponding obligation to return collateral. The Company is not
obligated to return the collateral if the borrower defaults. As of December 31, 2022, the obligation to return collateral was
comprised of only USDC.
