Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified in order to conform with the current period presentation. These
reclassifications have no impact on the Companyâ€™s previously reported consolidated net income.
Changes in presentation
During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company elected to change its presentation for deposits in transit from payment processors
and financial institutions, which are related to customer transactions. Under the new presentation, these funds are included in
customer custodial funds, whereas previously they were presented within the accounts and loans receivable, net of allowance
financial statement line item. The change allows the Company to present cash and deposits in transit as customer custodial funds
held for the exclusive benefit of customers, which the Company holds to meet its obligations for customer deposits at period end.
Additionally, the Company made a change in its presentation of customer custodial cash liabilities from operating activities, to
present them as financing activities within its consolidated statements of cash flows.
Comparative amounts have been recast to conform to current period presentation. These recasts had no impact on the consolidated
statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income or consolidated statements of changes in convertible
preferred stock and stockholders' equity."
