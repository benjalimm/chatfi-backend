Fair value measurements
The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be
received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair
value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and
significant to the fair value measurement:
•Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
assets or liabilities.
•Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
•Level 3: Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
