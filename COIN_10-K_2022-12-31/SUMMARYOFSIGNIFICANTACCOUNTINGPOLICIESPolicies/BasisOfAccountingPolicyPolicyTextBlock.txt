Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”), and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company’s subsidiaries are
entities in which the Company holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights, or where it exercises control.
Certain subsidiaries of the Company have a basis of presentation different from GAAP. For the purposes of the consolidated
financial statements, the basis of presentation of such subsidiaries is converted to GAAP. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
