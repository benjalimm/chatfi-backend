Concentration of credit risk
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, customer custodial funds, and accounts and loans receivable are
potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and customer custodial funds are
primarily placed with financial institutions which are of high credit quality. The Company invests cash and cash equivalents, and
customer custodial funds primarily in highly liquid, highly rated instruments which are uninsured. The Company may also have
corporate deposit balances with financial institutions which exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit of
$250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit
risk with respect to these accounts. The Company also holds cash at crypto trading venues and performs a regular assessment of
these crypto trading venues as part of its risk management process.
The Company held $861.1 million and $100.1 million of USDC as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The issuer of USDC
