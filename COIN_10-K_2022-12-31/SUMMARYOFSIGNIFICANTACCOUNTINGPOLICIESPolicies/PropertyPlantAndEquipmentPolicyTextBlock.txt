Property and equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term. The estimated useful lives of the Companyâ€™s
property, equipment, and software are generally as follows:

Property and EquipmentUseful LifeFurniture and fixtures
Three to five years
Computer equipment
Two to five years
Leasehold improvements
Lesser of useful life or remaining lease term
Capitalized software
One to three years


Construction-in-progress represents costs incurred on the construction of leasehold improvements that have not been completed or
placed in service as of the end of the year, and accordingly, no depreciation expense has been recorded.
Capitalized software consists of costs incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software or
implementation of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. Capitalized costs consist of salaries and compensation costs
for employees, fees paid to third-party consultants who are directly involved in development efforts, and costs incurred for
upgrades and enhancements to add functionality of the software. Other costs that do not meet the capitalization criteria are
expensed as incurred."
