Net income (loss) per share
The Company computes net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class
method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating
securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The
Company’s convertible preferred stock and certain of its restricted common stock were deemed participating securities. These
participating securities do not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the Company’s losses.
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the
period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock
and, when dilutive, potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potential shares of common stock consist of
incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants, vesting of RSUs, vesting of restricted common
stock, conversion of the Company’s convertible preferred stock and convertible notes, and settlement of contingent consideration.
