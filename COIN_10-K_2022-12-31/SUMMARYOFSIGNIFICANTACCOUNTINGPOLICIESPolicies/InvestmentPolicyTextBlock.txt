Investments
The Company holds the following categories of investments, which are included in other non-current assets on the consolidated
balance sheets.
Equity method investments
The Company holds equity investments in privately held companies. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for
investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% of the common stock or in-substance common stock in the entity, or
when it exercises significant influence over the entity. Under the equity method, the Company’s share of each entity’s profit or
loss is reflected in other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
Strategic investments
The Company’s strategic investments primarily include investments in equity instruments where the Company (1) holds less than 20%
ownership in the entity, and (2) does not exercise significant influence. These investments are recorded at cost and adjusted for
observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or
impairment.
