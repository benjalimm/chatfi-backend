Segment reporting
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is
regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the “CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual
segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM. The CODM reviews financial
information presented on a global consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and
evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment and one reportable
segment.
