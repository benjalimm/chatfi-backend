Customer crypto assets and liabilities
Customer crypto assets and liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to safeguard customers’ crypto assets in digital wallets
on the Company’s platform. The Company safeguards these assets for customers and is obligated to safeguard them from loss, theft,
or other misuse. The Company recognizes customer crypto liabilities and corresponding customer crypto assets, on initial
recognition and at each reporting date, at fair value of the crypto assets. Any loss, theft, or other misuse would impact the
measurement of customer crypto assets.
