Crypto assets held
The crypto assets held by the Company, with no qualifying fair value hedge, are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives, and are initially measured at cost. Crypto assets accounted for as intangible assets are subject to impairment
losses if the fair value of crypto assets decreases below the carrying value at any time during the period. The fair value is
measured using the quoted price of the crypto asset at the time its fair value is being measured in the Companyâ€™s principal
market. Impairment expense is reflected in other operating expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company
assigns costs to transactions on a first-in, first-out basis.
Crypto assets held as the hedged item in qualifying fair value hedges are initially measured at cost. Subsequent changes in fair
value attributable to the hedged risk are adjusted to the carrying amount of these crypto assets, with changes in fair value
recorded in other operating expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company recognizes crypto assets received through airdrops or forks if the crypto asset is expected to generate probable
future benefit and if the Company is able to support the trading, custody, or withdrawal of these assets. The Company records the
crypto assets received through airdrops or forks at their cost.
