Crypto asset borrowings
The Company borrows crypto assets from third parties on an unsecured basis. Such crypto assets borrowed by the Company are
reported in crypto assets held on the consolidated balance sheets.
The borrowings are accounted for as hybrid instruments, with a liability host contract that contains an embedded derivative based
on the changes in the fair value of the underlying crypto asset. The host contract is not accounted for as a debt instrument
because it is not a financial liability, is carried at the fair value of the assets acquired and reported in crypto asset
borrowings on the consolidated balance sheets. The embedded derivative is accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognized in other operating expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The embedded derivatives are included in
crypto asset borrowings on the consolidated balance sheets.
The term of these borrowings can either be for a fixed term of less than one year or can be open-ended and repayable at the option
of the Company or the lender. These borrowings bear a fee payable by the Company to the lender, which is based on a percentage of
the amount borrowed and is denominated in the related crypto asset borrowed. The borrowing fee is recognized on an accrual basis
and is included in other operating expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
