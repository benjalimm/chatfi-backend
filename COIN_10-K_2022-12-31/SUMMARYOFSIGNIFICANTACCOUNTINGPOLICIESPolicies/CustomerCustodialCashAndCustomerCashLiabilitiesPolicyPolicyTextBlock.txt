Customer custodial funds and customer custodial cash liabilities
Customer custodial funds represents restricted cash and cash equivalents maintained in segregated Company bank accounts that are
held for the exclusive benefit of customers and deposits in transit from payment processors and financial institutions. Customer
custodial cash liabilities represents the obligation to return cash deposits held by customers in their fiat wallets and unsettled
fiat deposits and withdrawals. Deposits in transit represent settlements from third-party payment processors and banks for
customer transactions. Deposits in transit are received within five business days of the transaction date. The Company establishes
withdrawal-based limits in order to mitigate potential losses by preventing customers from withdrawing the crypto asset to an
external blockchain address until the deposit settles. In certain jurisdictions, deposits in transit qualify as eligible liquid
assets to meet regulatory requirements to fulfill the Company’s direct obligations under customer custodial cash liabilities. The
Company restricts the use of the assets underlying the customer custodial funds to meet regulatory requirements and classifies the
assets as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill the Company’s direct obligation under customer custodial cash
liabilities.
Certain jurisdictions where the Company operates require the Company to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable
regulatory requirements and commercial law in these jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer
custodial cash liabilities. Depending on the jurisdiction, eligible liquid assets can include cash and cash equivalents, customer
custodial funds, and certain other customer receivables. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s eligible liquid assets
were greater than the aggregate amount of customer custodial cash liabilities.
