Derivative contracts
Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, other inputs or a combination of these factors. Derivative
contracts are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with changes in fair
value recognized in other operating expense, net.
The Company enters into arrangements that result in obtaining the right to receive or obligation to deliver a fixed amount of
crypto assets in the future. These are hybrid instruments, consisting of a debt host contract that is initially measured at the
fair value of the underlying crypto assets and is subsequently carried at amortized cost, and an embedded forward feature based on
the changes in the fair value of the underlying crypto asset. The embedded forward is bifurcated from the host contract, and is
subsequently measured at fair value.
The Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts that act as economic hedges against the impact of changes in Euro
on the Companyâ€™s intercompany transactions. The Company records changes in fair value of the forward contracts as part of other
expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
Derivatives designated as hedges
The Company applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge
accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. The Company uses
fair value hedges primarily to hedge the fair value exposure of crypto asset prices. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes
in the fair value of the derivative and the fair value of the hedged item are recognized in current-period earnings in other
operating expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized in the
same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.
