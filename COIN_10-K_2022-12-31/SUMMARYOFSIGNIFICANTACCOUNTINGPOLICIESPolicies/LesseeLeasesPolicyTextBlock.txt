Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in lease right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying
asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of future minimum lease
payments over the lease term. Most leases do not provide an implicit rate, so the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The
operating lease ROU assets also include any lease payments made before commencement and exclude lease incentives.
The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that those options
will be exercised. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has
made the policy election to account for short-term leases by recognizing the lease payments in profit or loss on a straight-line
basis over the lease term and not recognizing these leases on the consolidated balance sheets. Variable lease payments are
recognized in profit or loss in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company has real estate
lease agreements with lease and non-lease components for which the Company has made the accounting policy election to account for
these agreements as a single lease component.
