Business combinations
The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from
the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their
estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed is recognized as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs incurred by the Company are recognized as an expense in general and
administrative expenses within the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement.
During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, and to the extent that the value was not
previously finalized, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation
allowances are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to
collect information about facts and circumstance that existed at the date of acquisition and reevaluates these estimates and
assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that the Company is
within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets
acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations.
