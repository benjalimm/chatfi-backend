Long-lived assets, including ROU assets, goodwill, and acquired intangible assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets on an annual basis, or more frequently whenever circumstances
indicate a long-lived asset may be impaired. When indicators of impairment exist, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash
flows attributable to such assets. In the event future undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount of the assets,
the asset would be considered impaired. The impairment loss is measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and
the fair value of the assets.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a
business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis (October 1 for the Company)
and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying value. For the periods presented, the Company did not have any goodwill impairment charges.
Acquired intangible assets with a definite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.
Each period, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in
circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Intangible assets assessed as having indefinite lives
are not amortized, but are assessed for indicators that the useful life is no longer indefinite or for indicators of impairment
each period.
