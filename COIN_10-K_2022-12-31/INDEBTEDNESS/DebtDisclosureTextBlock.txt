Convertible senior notes
In May 2021, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the “2026
Convertible Notes”) pursuant to an indenture, dated May 18, 2021 (the “Convertible Notes Indenture”), between the Company and U.S.
Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2026 Convertible Notes were offered and sold in a private offering to qualified
institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
The 2026 Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year payable
semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2021. The 2026 Convertible Notes mature
on June 1, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The proceeds received of $1.4 billion were net of a 1%
original issue discount.
The initial conversion rate and conversion rate for the 2026 Convertible Notes is 2.6994 shares of the Company's Class A common
stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately
$370.45 per share of the Class A common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments under
certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture.
The 2026 Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders before December 1, 2025 only upon the occurrence of
certain events, and from and after December 1, 2025, at any time at their election until the close of business on the second
scheduled trading day immediately preceding June 1, 2026, only under certain circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company may
satisfy its conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock or a
combination of cash and shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, based on the applicable
conversion rate. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the
Convertible Notes Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period
of time. Additionally, in the event of a corporate event constituting a fundamental change (as defined in the Convertible Notes
Indenture), holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their 2026 Convertible
Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes being repurchased, plus accrued
and unpaid special interest or additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of the fundamental change repurchase.
The Company accounted for the 2026 Convertible Notes wholly as debt because (1) the conversion features do not require bifurcation
as a derivative under ASC 815 and (2) the 2026 Convertible Notes were not issued at a substantial premium.
Discounts on the 2026 Convertible Notes reflect a 1% original issue discount of $14.4 million and debt issuance costs related to
the 2026 Convertible Notes of $19.4 million, which include commissions payable to the initial purchasers and third-party offering
costs.
Capped calls
On May 18, 2021, in connection with the pricing of the 2026 Convertible Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated
capped call transactions (the “Capped Calls”) with certain financial institutions (the \"option counterparties\") at a cost of
$90.1 million. The Capped Calls cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of the Company’s Class A common
stock initially underlying the 2026 Convertible Notes. By entering into the Capped Calls, the Company expects to reduce the
potential dilution to its Class A common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes is settled in cash, to
reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes its Class A common
stock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2026 Convertible Notes. The Capped Calls have an initial strike price of
approximately $370.45 per share of Class A common stock and an initial cap price of approximately $478.00 per share of Class A
common stock.
The Capped Calls meet the criteria for classification in equity, are not remeasured each reporting period and are included as a
reduction to additional paid-in capital within stockholders’ equity.
Senior notesIn September 2021, the Company completed the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion of senior notes
due on October 1, 2028 (the “2028 Senior Notes”) and an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion of senior notes due on
October 1, 2031 (the “2031 Senior Notes” and together with the 2028 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were
issued within the United States only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act, and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The Company issued the Senior Notes at par and paid approximately $24.0 million in total debt issuance costs, which includes
commissions payable to the initial purchasers and third-party offering costs. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 2022 at 3.375% per annum for the 2028 Senior
Notes and 3.625% per annum for the 2031 Notes. The entire principal amount of the Senior Notes is due at the time of maturity,
unless repurchased or redeemed at an earlier date. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated September 17, 2021
(the “Senior Notes Indenture”), among the Company, the Guarantor (as defined below) and U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee.
The Senior Notes are redeemable at the Company’s discretion, in whole or in part, at any time. If redeemed prior to October 1,
2024 for the 2028 Senior Notes and October 1, 2026 for the 2031 Senior Notes, the redemption price is subject to a make-whole
premium calculated by reference to then-current U.S. Treasury rates plus a fixed spread, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. If
redeemed on or after those respective dates, the make-whole premium does not apply.
In addition, prior to October 1, 2024, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes with
net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 103.375% of the principal amount of the 2028 Senior
Notes to be redeemed and 103.625% of the principal amount of the 2031 Senior Notes to be redeemed, in each case, plus any accrued
and unpaid interest. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture), the
Company must offer to repurchase each series of Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the
Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date.
The Senior Notes are guaranteed by one of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries, Coinbase, Inc. (the “Guarantor”).
The indenture governing the Senior Notes contains customary covenants that restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries to incur debt and liens. The Company is not aware of any instances of non-compliance with the covenants as of
December 31, 2022.
