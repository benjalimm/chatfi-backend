"CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
On April 1, 2021, in anticipation of the Direct Listing and following a vote by the requisite holders of the convertible preferred
stock, all outstanding shares of the Company’s convertible preferred stock were converted into 8,556,952 shares of the Company’s
Class A common stock and 103,850,006 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock. Effective immediately following the conversion,
the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation (the “Restated Certificate of Incorporation”) to authorize
500,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock. See Note 17. Common Stock for additional details. The Company’s board of
directors (the “Board”) has the authority to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including
voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.
