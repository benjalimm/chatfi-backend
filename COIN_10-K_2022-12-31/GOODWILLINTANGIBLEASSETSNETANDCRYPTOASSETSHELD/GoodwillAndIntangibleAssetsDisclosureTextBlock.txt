The Company recorded gross impairment charges of $757.3 million, $329.2 million and $8.4 million during the years ended December
31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively, due to the observed market price of crypto assets decreasing below the carrying value during
the respective periods. The Company partially recovered impairments recorded during the respective periods through subsequent
crypto asset sales and disposals. Impairment expense is included in other operating expense, net in the consolidated statements of
operations.
See Note 14. Derivatives, for additional details regarding crypto assets held designated as hedged items in fair value hedges. See
Note 15. Fair Value Measurements, for additional details regarding the carrying value of the Company’s crypto assets held.
When the Company borrows crypto assets, it may be required to pledge collateral. The collateral requirements range from 100% to
110% of the fair value of the crypto assets borrowed, and the Company is required to pledge additional assets to maintain its
required collateral percentage. The lender may have the right to use the collateral. If the lender has the right to use the
collateral or if the collateral is fiat, the Company derecognizes the collateral that has been pledged and recognizes a right to
receive the collateral. The lender is not obligated to return the collateral if the Company defaults on its borrowings. The
Company has not defaulted on any of its borrowings. See Note 11. Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets, for additional details
regarding the assets pledged as collateral.
