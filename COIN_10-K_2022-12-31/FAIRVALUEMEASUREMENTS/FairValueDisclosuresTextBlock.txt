The Company did not make any transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021.

Company has valued the assets and liabilities using quoted market prices for the underlying crypto assets which is based on Level
2 inputs.
Level 3 contingent consideration arrangement liability
The following table presents a reconciliation of the contingent consideration arrangement measured at fair value on a recurring
basis using significant unobservable inputs (in thousands):

Year Ended December 31,20222021Balance, beginning of period$14,828$—Fair value recorded in connection with
acquisition—15,752Change in fair value(8,312)(924)Settlement(4,661)—Balance, end of period$1,855$14,828

On October 21, 2022, the Company issued 57,640 shares of its Class A common stock to settle a certain contingent consideration
arrangement pursuant to the terms of the arrangement.
The Company’s contingent consideration arrangements were included in other non-current liabilities and changes in fair value are
recognized through other expense (income), net.
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement was
determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model and applying a risk-adjusted discount rate to the expected payoff on each of the
settlement dates. The expected payoff was determined by forecasting revenues for the acquired entity and simulating changes to the
price of the Company’s Class A common stock, as well as Bitcoin and Ethereum market capitalization, using a risk-neutral Geometric
Brownian Motion Path. The simulations also utilized the estimated volatility of and correlation between these variables. The
following significant unobservable inputs were used:

Year Ended December 31,20222021Discount rate30.0 %30.0 %Volatility of forecasted revenues
100.0% - 129.0%
146.1 %

Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis
The Company’s non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, and crypto assets held but not
designated in hedging relationships are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. The Company’s strategic
investments are also measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on
Level 3 inputs. The carrying value of the Company’s strategic investments is adjusted based on an Option-Pricing Model that uses
publicly available market data of comparable companies and other unobservable inputs including expected volatility, expected time
to liquidity, adjustments for other company-specific developments, and the rights and obligations of the securities the Company
holds. Fair value of crypto assets held are predominantly based on Level 1 inputs.
Assets and liabilities not measured and recorded at fair value
The Company’s financial instruments, including certain cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, certain customer custodial
funds, USDC, customer custodial cash liabilities, short-term borrowings and loans receivable are carried at amortized cost, which
approximates their fair value. If these financial instruments were recorded at fair value, they would be based on Level 1 inputs,
except for short-term borrowings and loans receivable which would be based on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, respectively.
The Company estimates the fair value of its 2026 Convertible Notes and Senior Notes based on quoted prices in markets that are not
active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input. As of December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of the 2026 Convertible
Notes and Senior Notes were $826.1 million and $1.0 billion, respectively.
