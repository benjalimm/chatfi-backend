Reduction in force
On January 10, 2023, the Company announced a further restructuring plan (the \"Restructuring Plan\") to manage its operating
expenses in response to the ongoing market conditions impacting the cryptoeconomy and ongoing business prioritization efforts. The
Restructuring Plan involves a reduction of the Company's workforce by approximately 950 employees. The Company expects execution
of the Restructuring Plan to be substantially complete by the second quarter of 2023.
In connection with these actions, the Company estimates that it will incur approximately $149 million to $163 million in total
restructuring expenses, consisting of approximately $58 million to $68 million in cash charges related to employee severance and
other termination benefits. Of the aggregate charges that the Company expects to incur in connection with the Restructuring Plan,
the Company expects that approximately $91 million to $95 million will be in stock-based compensation expenditures relating to the
acceleration of the vesting of outstanding equity awards in accordance with the terms of such awards. The Company expects to
recognize substantially all of these charges in the first quarter of 2023.
