"ACQUISITIONS2022 Acquisitions
Unbound Security, Inc.
On January 4, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Unbound Security, Inc. (“Unbound”) by acquiring all issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock and stock options of Unbound. Unbound is a pioneer in a number of cryptographic security
technologies, which the Company believes will play a key role in the Company’s product and security roadmap.
In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the
acquisition method. The purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the excess recorded as goodwill, none of which is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce, synergies,
and the use of purchased technology to develop future products and technologies. The final allocation of purchase consideration to
assets and liabilities remains in process as the Company continues to evaluate certain balances, estimates, and assumptions during
the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). Any changes in the fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result in adjustments to goodwill. During the nine months ended September
30, 2022, a measurement period adjustment associated with deferred tax assets was recorded, resulting in an increase in other
non-current assets of $4.1 million and a corresponding reduction in goodwill.
The total consideration transferred in the acquisition was $258.0 million, consisting of the following (in thousands):

Cash$151,424 Cash payable126 Class A common stock of the Company103,977 RSUs for shares of the Company’s Class A common

Included in the purchase consideration are $21.7 million in cash and 85,324 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock that are
subject to an indemnity holdback. The cash and shares subject to the indemnity holdback will be released 18 months after the
closing date of the transaction.
The results of operations and the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in the condensed
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of

The intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives to technology and development
expenses for developed technology and general and administrative expenses for customer relationships. Amortization of the IPR&D
will be recognized in technology and development expenses once the research and development is placed into service as internally
developed software. Management applied significant judgment in determining the fair value of intangible assets, which involved the
use of estimates and assumptions with respect to development costs and profit, costs to recreate customer relationships, market
participation profit, and opportunity cost.
Total acquisition costs of $3.0 million were incurred in relation to the acquisition, which were recognized as an expense and
included in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a designated contract market (“DCM”) and the Company believes it has been a key stepping
stone on the Company’s path to offer crypto derivatives to retail and institutional customers in the United States.
In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the
acquisition method. The purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the excess recorded as goodwill, none of which is

presence, synergies, and the use of purchased technology to develop future products and technologies. The final allocation of
purchase consideration to assets and liabilities remains in process as the Company continues to evaluate certain balances,
estimates, and assumptions during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). Any changes in the fair value
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result in adjustments to goodwill. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2022, a measurement period adjustment associated with deferred tax assets was recorded, resulting
in an increase in other non-current assets of $0.3 million and a corresponding reduction in goodwill.

2021 Acquisitions
Bison Trails
On February 8, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Bison Trails Co. (“Bison Trails”) by acquiring all issued and
outstanding common stock and stock options of Bison Trails. Bison Trails is a platform-as-a-service company that provides a suite
of easy-to-use blockchain infrastructure products and services on multiple networks to custodians, exchanges and funds.
Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a minority ownership stake in Bison Trails, which was accounted for as a cost method
investment. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination
achieved in stages under the acquisition method. Accordingly, the cost method investment was remeasured to fair value as of the
acquisition date. The Company considered multiple factors in determining the fair value of the previously held cost method
investment, including the price negotiated with the selling shareholders and current trading multiples for comparable companies.
Based on this analysis, the Company recognized an $8.8 million gain on remeasurement, which was recorded in other expense, net in
the condensed consolidated statement of operations on the acquisition date.
The purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the excess recorded as goodwill, none of which is expected to be deductible
for tax purposes. The goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce, market presence, synergies, and the use
of purchased technology to develop future products and technologies.
The total consideration transferred in the acquisition was $457.3 million, consisting of the following (in thousands):

Class A common stock of the Company$389,314 Previously held interest on acquisition date10,863 Cash28,726 Replacement of Bison

The intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives to technology and development
expenses for developed technology and general and administrative expenses for user base. Amortization of the IPR&D will be
recognized in technology and development expenses once the research and development is placed into service as internally developed
software. Management applied significant judgement in determining the fair value of intangible assets, which involved the use of

participation profit, and opportunity cost.
Total acquisition costs of $3.7 million were incurred related to the acquisition, which were recognized as an expense and included
in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Other Acquisitions
During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company also completed three other acquisitions that were not material
individually, but were material when aggregated. In each of these acquisitions the Company acquired all issued and outstanding
common stock and stock options of the acquiree.
The total purchase consideration in each acquisition was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates, with the excess recorded as goodwill. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2022, measurement period adjustments associated with deferred tax assets were recorded, resulting in an
increase in other non-current assets of $1.9 million and a corresponding reduction in goodwill.
The aggregate total preliminary consideration transferred in these acquisitions was $135.7 million, consisting of the following
(in thousands):

Class A common stock of the Company - issued$51,760 Class A common stock of the Company - to be issued39,940 Cash27,795 Cash
payable412 Contingent consideration arrangement15,752 Aggregate total purchase consideration$135,659 

The aggregate purchase consideration included 160,840 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock which was issued six months
after the respective acquisition dates. The fair value of these shares on the respective acquisition dates was included in
additional paid-in capital. Additionally, 39,663 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock included in the aggregate purchase
consideration that are to be issued, are subject to an indemnity holdback. The shares subject to the indemnity holdback will be
released between 15 and 18 months after the closing date of each transaction.
Also included in the aggregate purchase consideration was the original estimated fair value of the contingent consideration
arrangement agreed to in one of the acquisitions. The contingent consideration consists of two separate tranches. The first
tranche will be settled one year after the closing date of the transaction and may result in delivery of up to 75,534 shares of
the Company’s Class A common stock if specified revenue targets are met during the first year after the closing date. The second
tranche will be settled two years after the closing date of the transaction and may result in delivery of up to another 75,534
shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, if specified revenue targets are met during the second year after the closing date.
For each tranche, the revenue targets are adjusted for changes in the combined Bitcoin and Ethereum market capitalization since
the closing date. The total number of the Company’s Class A common stock issued to settle the contingent consideration arrangement
will be adjusted downward in proportion to recognized revenues that do not meet the specified revenue targets.
In September 2022, upon resolution of the contingency and determination of the number of shares of the Company’s Class A common
stock to be issued under the first tranche of the contingent consideration arrangement, the Company reclassified the value of the
first tranche from other non-current liabilities into additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The
second tranche of the contingent consideration arrangement is included in other non-current liabilities and is subject to
subsequent measurement at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through other expense, net.
The results of operations and the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in the condensed
consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. The following table summarizes the aggregate estimated
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed using a cost-based approach (in thousands):

Cash and cash equivalents$4,915 Accounts and loans receivable, net of allowance57 Prepaid expenses and other current

liabilities649 Other non-current liabilities949 Total liabilities1,663 Net assets acquired$135,659 

The excess of aggregate purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was
recorded as goodwill of $86.0 million, of which $77.1 million is expected to be deductible for U.S. tax purposes. The goodwill
balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce, market presence, synergies, and the use of purchased technology to
develop future products and technologies.
The following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of
the dates of acquisition (in thousands, except for years data):

The intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives to technology and development
expenses for developed technology and general and administrative expenses for customer relationships and user base. Amortization
of the IPR&D will be recognized in technology and development expenses once the research and development is placed into service as
internally developed software. Management applied significant judgement in determining the fair value of intangible assets, which
involved the use of estimates and assumptions with respect to development costs and profit, costs to recreate customer
relationships, market participation profit, and opportunity cost. These valuations incorporate significant unobservable inputs
classified as Level 3.
Total acquisition costs of $3.5 million were incurred related to these other acquisitions, which were recognized as expenses and
included in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company also entered
into employment agreements with key employees of the acquirees, which included stock-based compensation arrangements. In
conjunction with these agreements, the Company recognized $3.2 million of compensation expenses on the acquisition dates included
in technology and development expenses. Stock-based compensation arrangements offered to these key employees with vesting
conditions will be recognized as compensation expense in future periods. See Note 15. Stock-Based Compensation, for additional
details regarding stock-based compensation issued to employees.
