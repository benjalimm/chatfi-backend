Use of estimates
The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
Significant estimates and assumptions include the determination of the recognition, measurement, and valuation of current and
deferred income taxes; the fair value of stock-based awards issued; the useful lives of long-lived assets; the impairment of
long-lived assets; the valuation of privately-held strategic investments, including impairments; the Company’s incremental
borrowing rate; the fair value of customer crypto assets and liabilities; the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in business combinations, including contingent consideration arrangements; the fair value of derivatives and related
hedges; the fair value of long-term debt; assessing the likelihood of adverse outcomes from claims and disputes; and loss
provisions.
Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties. To the extent
that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company’s condensed consolidated financial
statements will be affected. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities.
