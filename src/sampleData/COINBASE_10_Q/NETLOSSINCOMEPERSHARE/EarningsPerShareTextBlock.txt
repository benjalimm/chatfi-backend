Certain shares of restricted Class A common stock granted as consideration in acquisitions and the Company’s convertible preferred
stock outstanding during 2021 are participating securities. These participating securities do not contractually require the
holders of such shares to participate in the Company’s losses.
The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are
identical, except with respect to voting. As a result, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis and the
resulting income (loss) per share will, therefore, be the same for both Class A common stock and Class B common stock on an
individual or combined basis.
The following potentially dilutive shares were not included in the calculation of diluted shares outstanding as the effect would
have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):
